TESV-Friendlier-Wolves
======================

A Skryim mod that allows the player to edit the relationship between wolves and other important factions (player, vampires, werewolves). By default, if the player is a werewolf, wolves only have a disposition of 2 with the player, meaning that they are merely confidant in the player (will not attack player unless provoked). This mod allows the player to change this value to whatever they see fit. Furthermore, the user can even change the relationship of wolves with other factions, such as vampires.

PLANS FOR FUTURE VERSIONS: In the future, I plan to allow players to approach any wolf in the wild and make them a follower of the player. I also plan to create an option that allows the player to summon a pack of wolves upon transforming into a werewolf or by using a custom power.
